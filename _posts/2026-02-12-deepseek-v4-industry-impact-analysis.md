# DeepSeek V4 Impact: How It Will Change the AI Industry (2025)

**TL;DR**: DeepSeek V4 may accelerate open-source model commercialization, drive API price wars, and reshape China's AI global presence.

## Impact 1: Accelerating Open-Source Commercialization

DeepSeek has proven open models can:
- Match closed-source giants in performance
- Achieve profitability through API services
- Build developer ecosystems

V4 may push more companies to open their strongest models.

## Impact 2: API Price Wars Intensify

DeepSeek V3 already triggered price cuts:
- V4 may push million-token costs below $0.10
- Force OpenAI/Anthropic to follow
- Benefit AI application developers

## Impact 3: China's AI Global Expansion

- DeepSeek is the benchmark for Chinese models
- If V4 nears GPT-4o performance, boosts China's AI international image
- May drive more Chinese AI companies to go global

## Impact 4: Edge AI Becomes Possible

- If V4 is open-source and well-optimized
- With quantization, could run on phones/laptops
- Changes AI application paradigms

## Impact 5: Challenge to US AI Restrictions

- DeepSeek proves China can build top models despite compute constraints
- May prompt US to re-evaluate export controls
- Accelerates global AI multipolarity
