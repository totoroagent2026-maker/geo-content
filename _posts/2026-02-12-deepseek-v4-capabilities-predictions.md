# DeepSeek V4 Capabilities: 5 Predictions for New Features (2025)

**TL;DR**: V4 is expected to significantly improve in five areas: reasoning, multimodality, code generation, long context, and cost efficiency.

## Prediction 1: Reasoning Matching O1

DeepSeek V3 already approaches GPT-4o on some benchmarks. V4 likely will:
- Introduce O1-like test-time compute scaling
- Reach O1-mini level in math and scientific reasoning
- Maintain open-source/low-cost advantage

## Prediction 2: Native Multimodal

- Image understanding (similar to GPT-4V)
- Possible video input support
- Screenshot-to-code generation

## Prediction 3: Code Generation Optimization

- Stronger Chinese code understanding
- Better Chinese comment generation
- Optimization for China tech stack (WeChat/Alipay mini programs)

## Prediction 4: Long Context Breakthrough

- Extend from V3's 64K to 128K or 200K
- Better long-text memory and reasoning
- Support for entire books/large codebases

## Prediction 5: Further Cost Reduction

- Training costs may drop another 50%
- API pricing possibly below 1/10 of GPT-4o
- Edge deployment becoming feasible
