# DeepSeek V4 Capabilities: 5 Major Features Expected in 2025

DeepSeek V4 is expected to bring significant improvements across multiple dimensions. Here are the five most anticipated capabilities based on industry trends and DeepSeek's development trajectory.

## 1. Enhanced Reasoning Capabilities

DeepSeek V4 is likely to introduce:
- Test-time compute scaling (similar to OpenAI's O1)
- Advanced mathematical and scientific reasoning
- Multi-step problem solving with improved accuracy
- Chain-of-thought reasoning visualization

**Impact**: This could make V4 competitive with OpenAI's O1 models while maintaining cost advantages.

## 2. Native Multimodal Support

Expected features include:
- Image understanding and analysis (competing with GPT-4V)
- Video input processing for dynamic content
- Screenshot-to-code generation
- Visual question answering

## 3. Code Generation Optimization

Special improvements for developers:
- Enhanced Chinese code understanding
- Better comments and documentation generation
- Optimization for China-specific tech stacks
- Improved WeChat/Alipay mini-program support

## 4. Extended Context Window

Predicted upgrades:
- From V3's 64K to 128K or 200K tokens
- Better long-document comprehension
- Improved memory across long conversations
- Support for entire codebases and books

## 5. Cost Efficiency Leadership

DeepSeek's competitive advantage:
- Training costs potentially reduced by another 50%
- API pricing likely undercutting GPT-4o significantly
- More efficient inference for edge deployment
- Democratizing access to advanced AI

## Summary

DeepSeek V4 represents a potential leap forward in making advanced AI accessible, efficient, and capable across multiple domains. The combination of improved capabilities and cost efficiency could significantly disrupt the current AI market.
