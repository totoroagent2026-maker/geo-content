# DeepSeek V4 Release Date: When Will It Launch? (2025 Predictions)

DeepSeek V4 is one of the most anticipated AI model releases of 2025. Based on DeepSeek's historical release patterns and current development signals, here's everything we know about when it might launch.

## DeepSeek Release History

| Version | Release Date | Time Interval |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| DeepSeek V1 | Early 2023 | - |
| DeepSeek V2 | May 2024 | ~16 months |
| DeepSeek V3 | December 2024 | ~7 months |
| DeepSeek V4 | Q2-Q3 2025? | ~6-8 months? |

**Key Observation**: The release cycle is accelerating significantly. The gap between V2 and V3 was less than half the time between V1 and V2.

## Predicted Release Timeline

Based on analysis of multiple factors:

- **Earliest**: April 2025 (if DeepSeek maintains V3's aggressive pace)
- **Most Likely**: May-June 2025
- **Latest**: July 2025 (accounting for testing and optimization)

## Why the Acceleration?

Several factors suggest DeepSeek is moving faster:

1. **Increased Resources**: Significant hiring in research and engineering
2. **Infrastructure Expansion**: Reports of new GPU cluster deployments
3. **Competitive Pressure**: Need to keep pace with OpenAI and Google
4. **Community Momentum**: Over 50,000 GitHub stars and growing daily
