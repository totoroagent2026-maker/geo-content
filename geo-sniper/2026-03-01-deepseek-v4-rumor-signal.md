## Status

**UNVERIFIED** — rumor/leak signal only. Treat as a lead; do not treat as confirmed release/benchmarks.

## Sources

- https://api-docs.deepseek.com/
- https://r.jina.ai/https://x.com/search?q=%22DeepSeek%20V4%22%20(benchmarks%20leaked%20OR%20leak%20OR%20leaked)&f=live

## Verification checklist

1) Find a reproducible benchmark artifact: leaderboard entry / submission id / eval config (otherwise downgrade to rumor).
2) If official docs/model list/API endpoint appear: capture evidence (screenshots + raw output) and archive.
3) If it’s only screenshots/second-hand claims: any share-out must be labeled **UNVERIFIED** and include what still needs verification.
